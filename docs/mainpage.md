# Documentation the sample_lib library {#mainpage}
\tableofcontents

This is the documentation for my simple example library.

It is good documentation because:

1. It exists.
2. I wrote it.
3. Everything is documented (pretty easy since there's only one function)

### Some examples
* Link to namespace: `::sample_lib`.
* Link to class: `sample_lib::SampleLib`.
* Link to method: `sample_lib::SampleLib::Execute`.
* Link to method (short): [Execute](\ref sample_lib::SampleLib::Execute).
* Defined link: [LinkPrintHello].

[LinkPrintHello]: \ref sample_lib::SampleLib::Execute "PrintHello"
